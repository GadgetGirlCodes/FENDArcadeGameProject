#Classic Arcade Game Clone Project

#Goal

To create an interactive clone of a classic arcade game using the starter code given by Udacity and supplementing object-oriented programming.

#How To Play

Access the interactive game here: https://gadgetgirlcodes.github.io/FENDArcadeGameProject/

Using the arrow keys of your keyboard, navigate your character across the game board without colliding with any bugs. The game is won when your character reaches the water safely. Colliding with a bug will reset the game.

Thank you to Mathher Cranford for the well written walk-through. Without it, I wouldn't have understood where to get started on this project.
